# HealthLink-Data
This project automates the analysis of healthcare disparities by integrating Microsoft Power BI, Power Automate, Forms, and Excel Online into a seamless data pipeline. Manual reporting was replaced with real-time data collection, automated updates, and interactive dashboards, enabling HealthLink Analytics to monitor healthcare trends faster and with greater accuracy. The solution streamlined workflows, uncovered hidden patterns in hospital admissions and preventive care, and empowered decision-makers with data-driven insights to improve outcomes in underserved communities.

Project Overview: Automating Healthcare Disparities Data Analysis
🚀 The Challenge
Healthcare organizations working in underserved communities face several barriers to effective, data-driven decision-making:
Fragmented Data – Health records, demographics, and social determinants are scattered across systems.
Manual Processes – Data entry and reporting are often slow and error-prone.
Lack of Real-Time Insights – Without up-to-date dashboards, emerging health issues are hard to address quickly.
Geospatial Gaps – Limited ability to analyze disparities across different locations.
These challenges limit timely interventions and reduce the effectiveness of healthcare initiatives.

💡 The Approach
To address these challenges, I developed an automated data pipeline and interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power Platform tools:
Centralized Data Management – Four datasets (demographics, health indicators, social factors, geography) uploaded and maintained in Excel Online.
Automated Data Collection – Microsoft Forms + Power Automate feed new submissions directly into Excel tables, eliminating manual input.
Data Integration in Power BI – Power Query merges datasets with a Left Join to ensure visibility of new records, even without exact matches.
Dynamic Power BI Dashboard – Interactive parameters, filters, and a decomposition tree enable deep analysis of hospital admissions and preventive care visits.

📊 The Impact
This solution provided HealthLink Analytics with the ability to:
Monitor disparities in real time and respond faster to emerging health trends.
Improve data accuracy through automation, reducing manual errors.
Empower decision-makers with dynamic, drill-down visualizations in Power BI.
Streamline workflows so the team can focus on improving healthcare outcomes instead of wrangling data.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Power BI (Power Query, DAX, Parameters, Decomposition Tree)
Microsoft Forms (Data collection)
Power Automate (ETL automation)
Excel Online (Centralized data storage & updates)

🎯 Why This Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
Build end-to-end data solutions (collection → transformation → visualization).
Automate workflows to increase efficiency and accuracy.
Translate complex healthcare data into actionable insights for decision-makers.



This Project highlight my skills in Data Analytics, business intelligence, and automation. All of which directly support data-driven innovation in healthcare and beyond.
